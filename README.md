# hangman_game

My Hangman game in Vue is an interactive word-guessing game where players try to reveal a hidden word by guessing letters one at a time. Each correct guess displays the letter in its respective position within the word, while each incorrect guess adds the letter to the wrong guesses list. Players unlimited guesses before the game is over. The game features clear feedback on guessed letters, a counter for wrong guesses, and a display that updates as players guess letters. It provides a fun and challenging experience with a smooth user interface and real-time updates, built using Vue's reactive capabilities.
